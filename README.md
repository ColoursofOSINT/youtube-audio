# Youtube Audio Reworked

This extension is a fork of a no longer maintained [Firefox](https://github.com/animeshkundu/youtube-audio) extension.

This extension allows for just the audio of a video to be played. Saves battery and data.

Avaliable on firefox - [youtube-audio](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-audio/?src=search)
